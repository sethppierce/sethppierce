# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m  Seth Pierce

I'm a Software Developer and Marine Corps veteran. I have experience in full-stack web-development using React and Next.js, but I look forward to and am always excited to learn new tools! I'm currently a student at Code Fellows 401, but I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate and learn!
